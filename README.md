# Hokie Resort Data Warehouse Project (ACIS 5504)

A comprehensive data warehouse implementation for a hotel resort chain, demonstrating dimensional modeling, ETL processes, and business analytics.

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a star schema data warehouse for Hokie Resort, a hotel chain that operates across multiple locations.

- **`Customer Satisfaction Analysis by Loyalty Tier and Hotel Brand.png`**: Satisfaction metrics by segment
- **`Customer Satisfaction Analysis by Loyalty Tier.png`**: Loyalty tier satisfaction breakdown

### `/docs/` - Documentation & Architecture
- **`HokieResortDW_Star.png`**: Star schema diagram and data model
- **`Data Dictionary.docx`**: Comprehensive field definitions and business rules
- **`Data wearhouse mapping table.docx`**: Source-to-target mapping documentation
- **`Introducation of the hotal and question.docx`**: Project requirements and business context
- **`Reporting and Visualization.docx`**: Comprehensive reporting documentation

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

### Dimension Tables
- **GuestDim**: Customer information including loyalty tier and demographics

## üîÑ ETL Process

The ETL system handles data integration from two corporate databases:
- **Corp1**: Primary booking system
- **Corp2**: Secondary property management system

Key features:
- Incremental loading with upsert logic
- Automatic dimension key generation
- Data quality validation
- Business rule enforcement

## üìä Analytics Capabilities

### Revenue Optimization
- Analysis by hotel brand, season, and room type
- Revenue breakdown between room charges and ancillary services
- Seasonal pattern identification

### Cross-Selling Opportunities
- Ancillary revenue analysis by room type and booking channel
- Opportunity identification for additional service sales
- Channel performance comparison

### Customer Satisfaction
- Satisfaction scoring by loyalty tier and hotel brand

- Service quality benchmarking

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **ETL**: SQL Server stored procedures with cursor-based processing
- **Analytics**: Advanced SQL with ROLLUP and CUBE operations
- **Visualization**: Business intelligence dashboards and charts

## üìà Business Value

This data warehouse enables Hokie Resort to:
- Optimize pricing strategies based on demand patterns
- Identify cross-selling opportunities to increase revenue per guest
- Monitor and improve customer satisfaction across different segments
- Make data-driven decisions for hotel operations and marketing

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Database Setup**: Execute `database/schema.sql` to create the data warehouse schema
